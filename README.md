# VirtualTourist
This is my Virtual Tourist project for udacity. It uses the flickr API to let you virtually tour the world by holding down to place a map pin which, when clicked on shows you 30 random images posted near the location on flickr.
## Notice
Some of the code/assets, if not all of them, belong to Udacity or google images.
